# Haproxy Bins

## Description

Binaries statically linked from Haproxy project

## Why is this needed

Some projects use a proxy as a component for doing different things, 
like [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) or [haproxy-ingress](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/)
which are Kubernetes controllers routing network traffic in the background. 

For those purposes, it is more comfortable to maintain just a binary, with no-dependencies, and well versioned. 
The most performant proxy out there is Haproxy, and that is the mission for this repository.

## Paths in the project

- `.github` Github Actions to automate things
- `scripts` Scripts for building the binary
- `libs` _**[autogenerated]**_ Path for already compiled libraries 
- `tmp` _**[autogenerated]**_ Path for temporary files generated during the execution

## How to collaborate

This project is done using standard tools. Most of them are already present on most GNU/Linux distributions. We are open to
external collaborations for this project. For doing it you must:
- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/prosimcorp/haproxy-bins/fork)
- Make your changes to the code into a different branch
- Open a PR. The code will be reviewed and tested

> We are developers and hate bad code. For that reason we ask you the highest quality on each line of code to improve
> this project on each iteration.
